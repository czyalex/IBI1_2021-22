 The commit messages for Week 4 are informative so I recommit it and push again to the master to make the commit message informative

In week 5 variables.py I missed a part that example of true and false. So I add a part that example with ture and false in postive and negetive
Also, in week5 triangle I did not print the 10 values I only print the 10th value and forgot to write pseudocode. So I change the code to print the 10 values and add the presudocode.

In week 6 the health.py the scatter plot is not well label, so I add some label in the scatter plot.
